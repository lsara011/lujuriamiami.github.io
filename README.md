A little about myself:
My name is Luis Saravia. I was born in Miami Florida and a student in Florida International University.
Currently Studying two degrees: One in Hospitality and one in Information Technology.
Why two? Well because Hospitality was once a career that i wanted to pursue. Owning restaurants and being your own boss can be great and all
...Until you look at the sacrifices and read about how so many restaurants fail within the next five years. Sad but true. 
The biggest one of all was a person who ruined the image of hospitality alltogether which was one of my old bosses from my last job ( I currently work for a hospitality group where im cared for and love thankfully).
However, i was inspired in Informational Technology for two reasons.

1 - My dad serves in the military at the time of this writing. He would be stationed in Texas, Germany, and everywhere basically wherever the Army needed him to go. 
During this time, my mom's friend's husband (I dont know how to simplify this any further) would soon be my mentor. A kind spirited soul who is loving and my brother and I would play RockBand 2
on his PS3 every now and then with him. His job? Front end Development. He worked in the Broward County Library System for a long time and was a developer. 
He was caring for my brother and I since my father wasnt really around (My dad was not a bad father at all, i called him everyday growing up since itd hard to see him as i wouldve liked growing up).
In September of 2016, I received the news that ive dreaded as a 16 year old. My friend that i hung out with when i was at my mentor's house called me out of nowhere one day
and told me that my mentor had passed away. As i told my mom, she picked us up and went to his house to investigate if its true. 
Sadly, it was true. It was really hard for my family since my mentor took care of us and loved us dearly.
Because of his job and the type of person he was like, i knew that i wanted to carry on his legacy and become what he did. 

2 - Hospitality at the time sounded great as mentioned until a couple of things. You truly dont need a hospitality degree to own a business or restaurant. My mom owns a successful tire shop as a single mother 
taking care of my little sister aka my chiquita (Little one in spanish, a nickname that i gave her growing up and i still call her that to this day).and she doesnt have a degree, just a GED and earning well as a business owner 
.A front of house manager at a restaurant that i worked at before it closed down made the point that i mentioned earlier and it made sense. My Assistant Kitchen Manager doesnt even have his GED and still has a great salary. 
Why even continue pursuing the degree? 
When I took Hospitality Law at FIU, the professor mentioned that a great career would be IT in Hospitaliy. Bingo. Thats where the money hits. 
Ive always been interested in computers but where can i start? Helpdesk? Data Analyst? Web Development? Program Developer? 
Web Development of course! Everyone needs a website and someone to create that for them. So why not?
Ive watched day in the life: software programmer videos on youtube of what developers go through everyday. And it instantly caught more of my career choice.
I now know what I want to be.

Rest In Peace to my mentor, Sylvester Kerry Hathorn. 
From my brother, family, and I, Thank you for everything when you were still here with us, 
and thank you for continuing to be my motivation to become better everyday
and providing us with the best that you had to offer.
All love. 
Luis

Now for the website...

This is my first website ever! it is still in its early stages but why not showcase it for a bit?
My project consists of a fake club in Miami called Lujuria(Lust in Spanish).
I wanted to keep it red and black since i find those colors close to what the vibe would be like.
I am currently going through CodeCademy Front End Developer Career Path to learn HTML CSS and JavaScript. 
I get tired working in the kitchen for many years especially breaking my back and standing for long periods of time and would love a change
my work life balance has been very unstable for the past couple of years and would like to establish a set schedule for me to commit to. 
But i am also thoroughly committed to enter the field of IT and ready for new chapters.

Everyday is a good day
Luis Saravia
